# Data-Analytics---Week-1
# CHAPTER 1

What is Data Analytics?
Analytics is at the heart of modern business. Virtually every organization collects large quantities of data about its customers, products, employees, and service offerings. Managers naturally seek to analyze that data and harness the information it contains to improve the efficiency, effectiveness, and profitability of their work.

The ultimate role of a data analyst is to transform raw data into actionable insights that guide decision-making processes within an organization. This involves several key responsibilities and skills.

# Data Collection and Preparation:
Sourcing data from various channels, including databases, spreadsheets, and external sources.
Cleaning and organizing the data to ensure it is accurate, consistent, and ready for analysis.

# Data Analysis:
Employing statistical methods, machine learning techniques, or other analytic tools to interpret data.
Identifying trends, patterns, and correlations that might not be immediately obvious.

# Data Visualization and Storytelling:
Creating visual representations of the data, such as charts, graphs, and dashboards, to make complex information easily understandable.
Articulating findings in a compelling narrative to communicate the significance of the data to stakeholders.

# Decision Support:
Making recommendations based on data-driven insights to help guide business decisions.
Providing context around the data, including potential implications and future trends.

# Collaboration and Communication:
Working closely with other departments, such as marketing, finance, and operations, to understand their data needs and provide insights.
Effectively communicating complex data findings in a clear and concise manner to non-technical stakeholders.

# Continuous Learning and Adaptation:
Keeping up-to-date with the latest industry trends, tools, and technologies in data analysis.
Adapting to new types of data and analytical methods as the organization's needs evolve.

# Three pillars of Analytics
 Analytics is made possible by modern:
 -Data
 -Storage
 -Computing capabilities.

   # Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning

- Machine learning uses algorithms to discover knowledge in your datasets that you can then apply to help you make informed decisions about the future. That is true regardless of the specific subject matter expertise where you're working, as machine learning has applications across a wide variety of fields. 

For example, here are some cases where machine learning commonly adds value:

- Segmenting customers and determining the marketing messages that will appeal to different customer groups.
- Discovering anomalies in system and application logs that may be indicative of a cybersecurity incident.
- Forecasting product sales based on market and environmental conditions.
- Recommending the next movie that a customer might wish to watch based on their past activity and the preferences of similar customers.
- Setting prices for hotel rooms far in advance based on forecasted demand.

Artificial intelligence (AI) includes any type of technique where you are attempting to get a computer system to imitate human behavior. As the name implies, you are trying to ask computer systems to artificially behave as if they were intelligent.

Machine learning (ML) is a subset of AI techniques. ML techniques attempt to apply statistics to data problems in an effort to discover new knowledge. Or, in other terms, ML techniques are AI techniques designed to learn.

Deep learning is a further subdivision of machine learning that uses quite complex techniques, known as neural networks, to discover knowledge in a particular way. It is a highly specialized subfield of machine learning that is most commonly used for image, video, and sound analysis.  

# Analytics Tools

Software helps analysts work through each one of the phases of the analytics process. These tools automate much of the heavy lifting of data analysis, improving the analyst's ability to acquire, clean, manipulate, visualize, and analyze data. They also provide invaluable assistance in reporting and communicating results.

Some of these tools are well-known to most computer users. For example, people are generally familiar with spreadsheet tools such as Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets.

Other analytics tools require more advanced skills. For example, the R programming language is designed to provide analysts with direct access to their data, but it requires learning some basic coding skills.
